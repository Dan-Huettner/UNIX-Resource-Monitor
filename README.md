# UNIX Resource Monitor

## Overview
A hilariously large interactive Bash script for monitoring running processes and system resources.

## But... Why??
To test the limits of my abilities.

## How to Run
In the Bash shell, simply run the monitor.sh script as you would any other script.

## System Requirements
A recent version of Ubuntu, or likely any other GNU/Linux distribution, should be just fine.
